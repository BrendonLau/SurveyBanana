2. Paste the file in the `backend` root directory

### Running the application
1. Build the frontend image by running `docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> .` in the `frontend` root directory
2. Run `docker run -p 3000:3000 <IMAGE_NAME>` to start the frontend
3. Build the backend image by running `docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> .` in the `backend` root directory
